* Learn to create relational and NoSQL data models to fit the diverse needs of data consumers. Use ETL to build databases in PostgreSQL and Apache Cassandra. (Project 1 and Project 2)
* Learn to create cloud-based data warehouses and sharpen data warehousing skills, deepen knowledge of data infrastructure, and be introduced to data engineering on the cloud using Azure. (Project 3)
* Learn about the big data ecosystem and how to use Spark to work with massive datasets. Store big data in a data lake and develop Lakehouse architecture on the Azure Databricks platform. (Project 4)
* Learn to build, orchestrate, automate and monitor data pipelines in Azure using Azure Data Factory and pipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics. Build, trigger, and monitor data pipelines on the Azure platform for analytical workloads and run data transformations, optimize data flows, and work with data pipelines in production. (Project 5)
* Master the theory and practice of Agile Project management with hands-on examples. Execute a Python centric Continuous Integration strategy that uses testing best practices, including open source code quality tools such as pylint and pytest. Couple Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) with Continuous Delivery using Azure Pipelines to streamline the deployment of applications to Azure. (Project 6)
